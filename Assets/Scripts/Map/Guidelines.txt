- I definitely prefer modability over smoothness. I think, longterm, what will keep this project alive is modding, so we should strive to add more modding options instead of removing them. I'm ok with a less smooth render. We can always try to improve that in the future.

- I prefer your second river system which draws rivers as lines by connecting adjacent river biome cells. Maybe you could use these two TerrainCell properties: RiverId and FlowingWater in addition to the biome, to better identify which cells contain river flows and where they connect to.

- It's ok if some rivers appear disconnected. In real life, not all rivers flow continually to the ocean, there might be disconnections where rivers just evaporate or they flow underground. On the other hand, not all rivers are visible at high altitudes (the Nile would be barely visible if not for the vegetation that surrounds its borders). Also some small rivers and brooks are covered in canopy or are indistinguishable from marshlands. We would just need to see how often these disconnections happen and how we can reduce them. One idea I have is that I could improve the terrain generation algorithm to do a second pass that adds more detail to cells with flowing water to better define river borders.

- Your coastline maps look awesome! I think I prefer the first one that looks more smooth and shows less artifacts. It looks a bit more natural to me. One point though: I originally intended the coastline map to look more like old cartographic maps which are not as detailed as modern maps, but also look a bit more artistic. Mountain ranges should be identifiable, thought they shouldn't be that opaque or prominent as in your version. It should be possible to identify political entities and other details when overlayed on top, and I think your rendering would hide them quite a bit. Also, coast lines should be wider and more prominent. In your zoomed out view they are barely visible at points. For the same reason, I ignore small rivers when drawing coastlines to avoid breaking the landmasses too much.

- Don't worry about the elevation view. It's the less developed one and I use it mostly for debugging purposes. It could certainly be improved in many ways (for example, by adding altitude lines) but it's not important as you say.

- how your renders would look with overlays on top, or when rendered on top of the spherical map mode. Also, just so that you know, I use a custom mesh for the planet sphere, not the default Unity one which is not ideal for displaying grid map textures.
