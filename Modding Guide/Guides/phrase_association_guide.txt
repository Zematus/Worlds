---- Phrase Association Guide ----

Phrase associations are used along with the element and one or more adjectives to build translatable composite words or noun phrases.

-- An association can be used to form a noun phrase. I which case it must be defined as follows: '<association word>,<relations>,<form>'

  Here's a description of each part:
    - <association word>: an action noun or attributive verb. Refer to language_modding_guide.md for more details on how to define translatable nouns and verbs
    - <relations>: one or more prepositions (separated by pipes, '|') that can be used to link the association word with the element
    - <forms>: one or more grammatical forms (separated by pipes, '|') the element can take as part of the noun phrase. They can be one of the following:
      -- 'ns': proper name singular. Examples: "The Stone", "Mount"
      -- 'ds': definite singular. Examples: "the mount", "stone"
      -- 'is': indefinite singular. Examples: "a stone", "an arch"
      -- 'dp': definite plural. Examples: "the stones", "mounts"
      -- 'ip': indefinite plural. Examples: "stones", "archs"
      -- 'u': uncountable. Examples: "water", "air"

  Example association strings that can be used to form noun phrases:

    '[nrv]throw:er,of,ip|ns'             (Examples: "thrower of the stone", "thrower of boulders", or "rockthrower")
    '[iv(bear,ts,past)]born,between,ip'  (Examples: "born between trees" or "waterborn")
    '[nrv]break:er,of,ip|ns'             (Examples: "breaker of chains", "Breaker of The Stone Wall" or "wallbreaker")
    '[iv(bear,ts,past)]born,under,ns'    (Examples: "born under the sky", "born under clouds" or "starborn")
    '[nrv]cut:ter,of,u'                  (Examples: "cutter of grass" or "woodcutter")

-- Associations can also be used exclusively to form composite words. In such cases, only the '<association word>' part is needs to be defined.

  Example association strings that can be used to only form composite words:

    '[ran]work:er'   (Examples: "stoneworker", "woodworker")
    '[ran]dance:r'   (Examples: "skydancer", "raindancer")
