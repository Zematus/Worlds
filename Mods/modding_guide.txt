-- Creating a new mod for Worlds - History Simulator --

The first step to create a a new mod is to create a folder within the 'Mods' folder. Within that folder, several folders can be added depending on the type of content the mod will contain.

Here's a list of moddable components that can be added to a mod:
- Adjectives: This folder will contain all adjective definition files required by the mod
- Biomes: This folder will contain all biome definition files required by the mod
- Discoveries: This folder will contain all discovery definition files required by the mod
- Elements: This folder will contain all element definition files required by the mod
- RegionAttributes: This folder will contain all region attribute definition files required by the mod
- Layers: This folder will contain all layer definition files required by the mod

Each folder can contain one or more JSON definition files. The names of the files are not important. What is important is that they follow the definition structure required by the type of mod and that they are located in the correct folder. If a specific folder would not have any files on it, then the folder doesn't need to be present within the mod.

The game can load more than one mod at a time. It will load them in alphabetical order. So make sure that mods that are dependent on other mods are loaded in the correct order.

-- Biome Mods --

Biome definitions are used to define the biomes assigned to each cell on a newly generated planet.

Biome definition files must all be placed within the 'Biomes' folder. Files can have any name as long as they have the .json extension. A single file can have more than one biome definition, but duplicate definitions will override each other across a single file, across a set of files, and across a set of active mods. Try to have only one single definition of a biome per mod.

You can find more information on how to write a biome mod within the Biome_modding_guide.txt file located in the 'Mods/Base' folder.

-- Layer Mods --

Layer definitions are used to define the layers assigned to each cell on a newly generated planet.

Layer definition files must all be placed within the 'Layers' folder. Files can have any name as long as they have the .json extension.

Try to have only one single definition of a layer per mod.
