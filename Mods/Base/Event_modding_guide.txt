---- Event Modding Guide ----

Event modding files are located within the 'Events' folder. To be valid, mod files must have the .json extension and have the following file structure:

-- File Structure --

{
  "events": [ -- list of events --
    {
      "id":                         -- (required) Unique event identifier (see note 2)
      "name":                       -- (required) Name of event
      "target":                     -- (required) Target entity type for the event. Has to be either "group" or "faction"

      "assignOn":                   -- (optional) List of types of situations that would make an event of this type to be assigned to the target. Defaults to "event" (see notes 3)

      "properties":                 -- (optional) List of PROPERTIES that are available to the event definition. Properties are predefined values and expressions that can be reused in different places within the definition. Please read properties_guide.txt for more details on how to define valid properties

      "assignmentConditions":       -- (optional) List of BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS to evaluate before assigning the event to the target. If any of the expressions evaluate to 'false', then the event is not assigned. Please read expressions_guide.txt for more details on how to define valid boolean expressions. NOTE: assignment conditions are also evaluated before triggering an event

      "triggerConditions":          -- (optional) List of BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS to evaluate before triggering the event already assigned to the target. If any of the expressions evaluate to 'false', then the event is not triggered. Please read expressions_guide.txt for more details on how to define valid boolean expressions

      "timeToTrigger":              -- (required) NUMERIC EXPRESSION that defines the amount of time to pass before triggering an event. the expression must evaluate to a value between 1 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

      "effects":                    -- (required) List of EFFECT EXPRESSIONS to evaluate after an event has successfully triggered. These can introduce changes to the target or any related entity. Please read expressions_guide.txt for more details on how to define valid effect expressions

      "repeatable":                 -- (optional) Can only have 'true' or 'false' as value (default: 'false'). If 'true', then the will be an attempt to reassign the event to the same target after every successful or unsuccessful trigger attempt

      "debug":                      -- (optional) Can only have 'true' or 'false' as value (default: 'false'). This an option to assist in mod development. If this is 'true', and 'Debug Mode' is enabled within the game, then debug information specific to this event will be logged during the game execution.
    },
    ... -- additional events --
  ]
}

-- Notes --
1. List of values must be enclosed within square brackets and separated by commas. Remove any trailing commas on any list enclosed by square brackets, or you'll get a JSON parsing error.
2. Do not duplicate event ids unless you want to specifically replace another event already loaded.
3. List of valid assignment types:
  - "event": This event type can be assigned by other events (default).
  - "spawn": This event type is assigned when the target entity spawns.
  - "status_change" This event type is assigned when a status change occurs to the target entity (only applicable to faction target types).
