---- Element Modding Guide ----

Element modding files are located within the 'Elements' folder. To be valid, mod files must have the .json extension and have the following file structure:

-- File Structure --

{
  "elements": [ -- list of elements --
    {
      "id":                  -- (required) Unique element identifier, if more than one definition share ids, only the last one loaded will be used
      "name":                -- (required) Name of element (in plural form, see note #2)

      "adjectives":          -- (optional) List of applicable adjectives, separated by commas
      "regionConstraints":   -- (optional) List of region constraints, separated by commas (see note #3)
      
      "phraseAssociations":  -- (required) List of phrase association strings, separated by commas (see note #4)
    },
    ... -- additional elements --
  ]
}

-- Notes --
1. Remove any trailing commas or the file won't be parsed
2. The name string should be written in translatable plural form. Examples: "stone:s", "grass:es". Refer to language_modding_guide.txt for more details on how to define translatable nouns.
3. Each region constraint within the list must be encased within single quotes. These are used to decide whether or not to associate the element with a particular region. Refer to region_constraints_guide.txt for more details on how to define and use region constraints
4. Each phrase association string within the list must be encased in single quotes. These are used to form nouns or noun phrases for procedurally generated proper names and other types of texts. Refer to phrase_association_guide.txt for more details on how to define phrase associations
