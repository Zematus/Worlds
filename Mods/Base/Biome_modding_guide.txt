---- Biome Modding guide ----

Biome modding files are located within the 'Biomes' folder. To be valid, mod files must have the .json extension and have the following file structure:

      "altitudeSaturationSlope":    -- (optional) Slope with which the biome will reach max saturation within the cell (between 0.001 and 1000 inclusive) (see note #7)
      "minRainfall":                -- (optional) Minimum cell rainfall at which this biome can be present (mm per year)
      "maxRainfall":                -- (optional) Maximum cell rainfall at which this biome can be present (mm per year)
      "rainfallSaturationSlope":    -- (optional) Slope with which the biome will reach max saturation within the cell (between 0.001 and 1000 inclusive) (see note #7)
      "minTemperature":             -- (optional) Minimum cell temperature at which this biome can be present (centigrade, yearly average)
      "maxTemperature":             -- (optional) Maximum cell temperature at which this biome can be present (centigrade, yearly average)
      "temperatureSaturationSlope": -- (optional) Slope with which the biome will reach max saturation within the cell (between 0.001 and 1000 inclusive) (see note #7)

      "survivability":              -- (required) Base probability of a given human group surviving in this biome (between 0 and 1 inclusive)
      "foragingCapacity":           -- (required) Base foraging capacity this cell provides to a human group (between 0 and 1 inclusive)
      "accessibility":              -- (required) Base travel modifier through and within this cell (between 0 and 1 inclusive)
      "arability":                  -- (required) Base arability modifier for this cell (between 0 and 1 inclusive)

      "layerConstraints": [
        {
          "layerId":                -- (required) Id of the layer to use as constraint
          "minValue":               -- (optional) Minimum layer value in cell at which this biome can be present (between -1000000 and 1000000 inclusive) (see note #4 and #6)
          "maxValue":               -- (optional) Maximum layer value in cell at which this biome can be present (between -1000000 and 1000000 inclusive) (see note #5 and #6)
          "saturationSlope":        -- (optional) Slope with which the biome will reach max saturation within the cell (between 0.1 and 1 inclusive) (see note #7)
        }

  ]
}

-- Notes --
1. Remove any trailing commas or the file won't be parsed
2. Optional 'min' attribute values (altitude/rainfall/temperature) not defined will be assigned the minimum attribute value of its category
3. Optional 'max' attribute values (altitude/rainfall/temperature) not defined will be assigned the maximum attribute value of its category
4. Only set a minValue if the biome is not supposed to be present at values less than minValue. Otherwise do not add this constraint property
5. Only set a maxValue if the biome is not supposed to be present at values greater than maxValue. Otherwise do not add this constraint property
6. A layer constraint's minValue or maxValue shouldn't be greater than the specific layer's maxPossibleValue
7. Saturation represents how close is particular biome from filling a particular cell and it helps calculate the relative strength of a particular biome in regards to others within a single cell. The saturation slope indicates how quickly a particular biome reaches it's saturation point within a cell. A saturation slope of 0 indicates that the biome never increases it's saturation level above 0. A  slope of 1 indicates that the biome reaches it's maximum saturation at the exact midpoint between the minimum and maximum values of a particular property. A slope greater than 1 indicates the biome reaches it's maximum saturation faster. A slope less than 1 indicates the biome won't reach it's saturation point. When undefined, the default saturation slope is 1
